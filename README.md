# Binary Converter


The app converts binary into decimal notation in two instances.
The first one the user enters the binary value and receives the response in decimal.

The second one is interactive, there is a byte (eight aligned bits) and the user can click each bit to toggle its value between 0 and 1. The result of the current value of the byte is outputted with each modification.

Used for testing a modified version of TinyTest.js so it can work better with Node.
